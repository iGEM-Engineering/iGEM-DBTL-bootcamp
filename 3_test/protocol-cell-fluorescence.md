# iGEM Bootcamp Fluorescence Measurement protocol

## Overview
In this protocol we will use a plate-reader to measure the OD600 and GFP fluorescence of our constructs in cells.

Before performing this experiment, you need to perform the calibration measurements. 
Please do not proceed unless you have completed the [calibration protocol](/protocol-calibration-fluorescein.md). 

**Important:** For the calibration and your experiments, you must use the same type of plates and the same volumes. 
You must also use the same settings (e.g., filters or excitation and emission wavelengths) for the calibration and for the experiment. 
If you do not use the same plates, volumes, and settings, the measurements cannot be calibrated properly.

## Protocol in short

## Protocol Materials

- Constructs
- LB Broth + Kanamycin (50 ug/mL)
- LB Agar + Kanamycin (50 ug/mL)
- Kanamycin stock solution (50 mg/mL)*
- Ice
- Shaking incubator (normal for culture tubes)
- Petri dish (x 5)
- 14mL culture tube (x10)
- 50mL conical tube (x20)
- 96 well plate black with transparent flat bottom
- Pipette for 200uL, (single and/or 8-channel)
- Plate reader able to measure absorbance at 600nm and fluorescence either with filters or monochromator.

## Day 0
1. Prepare 5 Petri dishes with LB Agar + Kanamycin (Kan) growth medium, and label petri dishes with the following convention: Construct Name, Day 0.
2. Streak out constructs from glycerols to their coressponding labeled petri dish. 
3. Incubate overnight (for at least 16 hours) at 37.0°C.

## Day 1
4. Prepare 15 culture tubes (50mL) with 12.0mL of LB Broth + Kan.
You will pick three colonies per construct (5 constructs x 3 colonies for 15 tubes total).
Label the tubes, accordingly, naming these tubes with the following
convention: i.e., Construct Name, Colony 2, Day 1.
4. Inoculate (by picking the colonies) into each one of the tubes from Step 3 into their correspondingly labelled tube. 
5. Incubate all 15 culture tubes overnight for 16 hours at 37°C and 220 rpm in a shaker incubator.


## Day 2

### Preparation of the Intermediate dilution and OD measurement
Here you want to perform a dilution from the previous day's cultures to start the experiment with a known cell density (OD600). For this you need to perform an intermediate dilution to measure OD600 before performing the final dilutions.

5. Prepare 15 culture tubes (14mL) tubes to make the intermediate dilutions from the overnight cultures from Step 4. 
Name these new tubes with the same convention as Step 4, changing the day number as follows: i.e., Construct Name, Colony 2, Day 2, Intermediate Dilution.
6. Dilute each of 15 culture (day 1, Step 4) samples at a 1:10 to 1:20 ratio into LB
Broth + Cm (tubes prepared in Step 5). NOTE: As an example, to make a 1:20
dilution, you need to add 4750uL of LB Broth + Cm, and then add 250uL of the
day 1 culture. Maintain at 4.0°C while performing dilutions. (You can also do
this on ice). Take the appropriate volume from the Intermediate Dilutions
(tubes made in this Step 6) and read the absorbance at 600nm in a
spectrophotometer, i.e., the OD600.

Preparation of the Final Dilution
7. Prepare 16 new 50mL tubes to perform the final dilutions using the
Intermediate dilutions from Step 6. We will name these new tubes with the
same convention as Step 4 as follows: i.e. Test Device 3, Colony 2, Final
Dilution.
8. Use the culture-dilution-calculator-template.xlsx sheet (or any other
means) to calculate the dilutions by inserting the measured OD (from Step 6)
in the second column (Initial OD source). The needed volumes to make the
dilutions will appear in the corresponding columns culture volume and media
volume: As an example, to make 12mL dilution at 0.02 OD600 from a culture at
0.38 OD600, (sample 1), you will need to add 631.58uL of culture (from the
Intermediate Dilution) to 11368.42uL of LB broth + Cm media as shown here.



**Note:** If your equipment does not have the exact wavelengths of bandpass wavelengths, choose the nearest one and take note.
