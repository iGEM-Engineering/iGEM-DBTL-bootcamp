# Glossary

### Assembled Part 
A part, plus any 5’ or 3’ flanking scars, in the post-assembly context of a composite part.

### Assembly
A plan for combining a set of parts in order to build one or more composite parts.

### Backbone
A DNA construct into which parts are intended to be inserted at one or more designated insertion sites (often, but not always, a circular plasmid).

### Composite Part
A part designed as the composition of two or more other parts through an assembly plan.

### Drop-Out Sequence 
A portion of a backbone at an insertion site that is removed when a part is inserted at that site. 
Some backbones include drop-out parts while others do not.

### Part Extract
A part, plus any 5’ or 3’ flanking sequences, that has been extracted from a part in backbone as part of an assembly process.

### Part in Backbone
A backbone with at least one insertion site where a part insert has been incorporated.

### Part Insert 
A part, plus any 5’ and 3’ flanking sequences, that is intended to be placed into a designated insertion site of a backbone.

### Scar 
A sequence that is produced by the combination of flanking sequences in an assembly.

### Unitary Part
Any part that is not designed with reference to an assembly, often but not always having a well-defined role such as a CDS or promoter.
