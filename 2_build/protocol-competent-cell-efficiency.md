# Competent Cell Efficiency

## Overview
You will transform control plasmid DNA into the competent cells you have purchased or [made](./protocol-preparing-competent-cells.md) in the lab to calculate their efficiency.

The protocol below is adapted from iGEM's [Competent Cell Test Kit protocol](https://parts.igem.org/Help:Competent_Cell_Test_Kit).
The Competent Cell Test Kit is no longer offered by iGEM, but the protocol can still be used if you have access to 10 pg/µL and 100 pg/µL control plasmids.


## Materials needed
### Equipment
- Lab marker / Sharpie
- Container for ice
- 42°C Water bath (or heating block set to the same temperature)
- 37°C Incubators (oven and shaker)
- Sterile glass beads or sterile cell spreader
- Micropipettors and tips for the following volumes: 
    - 1 µL
    - 100 µL
    - 950 µL

### Consumables
- 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
- Ice
- Competent cell aliquot(s)
- 100 pg/µL control plasmid
- 10 pg/µL control plasmid
- SOC media
- Agar plates with antibiotic that matches control plasmid’s resistance

## Protocol

1. **Prepare tubes and ice bucket:** 
Label 1.5 ml tubes with the control plasmid name and concentration. 
Fill the lab ice bucket with ice, and pre-chill 1.5 ml tubes (one tube for each transformation) in a floating foam tube rack.
    - Do triplicates (3 each) of each control plasmid if possible, so you can calculate an average colony yield.

2. **Thaw competent cells on ice:** 
This may take 10-15 min for a 200 µl stock. 
Dispose of unused competent cells. Do not refreeze unused thawed cells, as it will drastically reduce transformation efficiency.

3. **Pipette 50 µl of competent cells into 1.5 ml tube:** 
50 µl in a 1.5 ml tube per transformation. 
Tubes should be labeled, pre-chilled, and in a floating tube rack for support. 
Keep all tubes on ice. 

4. **Pipette 1 µl of resuspended DNA into 1.5 ml tube:** 
Pipette from well into appropriately labeled tube. Gently pipette up and down a few times. 
Keep all tubes on ice.

5. **Close 1.5 ml tubes, incubate on ice for 30 min:** 
Tubes may be gently agitated/flicked to mix solution, but return to ice immediately.

6. **Heat shock tubes at 42°C for 45 sec:** 
1.5 ml tubes should be in a floating foam tube rack. 
Place the floating rack in a water bath set to 42°C to ensure the bottoms of the tubes are submerged.

7. **Incubate on ice for 5 min:** 
Return transformation tubes to the ice bucket and let them recover for 5 minutes.

8. **Pipette 950 µl SOC media to each transformation:** 
SOC should be warmed to room temperature before use. Check for contamination.

9. **Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour, shaking at 200-300 rpm**

10. **Pipette 100 µL of each transformation onto LB agar plate with the appropriate antibiotic:** 
Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. 
This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.

11. **Incubate transformations overnight (14-18 hr) at 37°C:** 
Incubate the plates upside down (agar side up). 
If incubated for too long, colonies may overgrow and the antibiotics may start to break down; un-transformed cells will begin to grow.

12. **Count colonies:** 
Count the number of colonies on a light field or a dark background, such as a lab bench. 
Use the following equation to calculate your competent cell efficiency. 
If you've done triplicates of each sample, use the average cell colony count in the calculation.


## Calculating Efficiency
Competent cells efficiency is reported as cfu/µg where "cfu" means "colony-forming unit" and is a measurement of cells.  Competent cells should have an efficiency of **1.5x10<sup>8</sup> to 6x10<sup>8</sup> cfu/µg DNA**. 

`cfu/µg = [ Number of colonies on plate (cfu) / Amount of DNA plated (ng) ] x 1000 (ng/µg)`


_Note:_ The measurement "**Amount of DNA plated**" refers to how much DNA was plated onto each agar plate, not the total amount of DNA used per transformation. You can calculate this number using the following equation:

**Amount of DNA plated (ng)**<br />
Volume DNA added (1 µL) x concentration of DNA (convert pg//µL to ng/µL) x  [ volume plated (100 µL) / total reaction volume (1000 µL) ]

**Example for 10 pg/µL control:**<br />
(1 µL DNA added) x (convert 10 pg/µL to ng/µL) x  [ (100 µL) / (1000 µL) ] = ng DNA added

1 x 0.01 x 0.1 = **0.001 ng DNA added** 

### Example Results
Here are some sample results:

| DNA concentration | 10 pg/µL | 100 pg/µL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of colonies | 280 | 1000+ |

cfu/µg = [ Number of colonies on plate (cfu) / Amount of DNA plated (ng) ] x 1000 (ng/µg)

cfu/ug = ( 280 / 0.001 ) x 1000
 
cfu/ug = 2.8x10<sup>8</sup>
