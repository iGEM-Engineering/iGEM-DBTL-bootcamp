# Preparing Competent Cells

## Overview
The protocol below is adapted from Barrick Lab's [Preparing Chemically Competent Cells using the CaCl<sub>2</sub>/Glycerol Method](https://barricklab.org/twiki/bin/view/Lab/ProtocolsChemCompCellsCaCl2Glycerol)

The protocol below should yield 100 tubes of chemically competent cells. 
If fewer tubes are needed, volumes can be adjusted proportionally for steps 2-4.

## Materials needed
### Equipment
- Floor centrifuge
- Sterile 50 mL centrifuge tubes
- Shaking 37°C incubator
- Sterile 1 L flasks
- Spectrophotometer (for measuring OD600)

### Consumables
- Liquid nitrogen / Dry ice
- Polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 - 2 ml)

### Buffers and Solutions
- LB Medium
- 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> 10% glycerol buffer (see composition below):
    - Filter sterilize and store at 4°C

_100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> 10% Glycerol Buffer:_
| Reagent | Amount / L | Final Conc. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CaCl<sub>2</sub> | 11.10 g | 100 mM |
| 80% Glycerol | 125 mL | 10% | 
| H2O | to 1 L | |

### Other
- _E. coli_ strains: 
    - DH5alpha, NEB5alpha, DH10B, E.cloni (10G invitrogen), XL1-blue, Mach1 T1, MG1655
    - _Note:_ We recommend avoiding the following strains: TOP10, BL21 (and derivatives).
    BL21 (and derivatives) are mainly optimized for protein production and not for cloning purposes. 
    For this protocol, it means that transformation might be more difficult than with a strain optimized for cloning, and plasmid purification might give a lower yield. 

## Protocol

1. Competent stocks of _E. coli_ strains were prepared by inoculating 10 ml of LB medium with a small portion of cells scraped from the surface of a frozen glycerol stock not previously exposed to CaCl<sub>2</sub>.
2. Following incubation overnight at 37 °C with agitation, cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 in 500 ml LB medium and further incubated until reaching an OD600 between 0.4 and 0.6.
3. Aliquots of approximately 35 ml were centrifuged at 3400 g for 10 minutes at 4°C (If not possible, use room temperature) and the combined pellets resuspended in 150 ml of ice cold 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> 10% glycerol solution.
4. Cells were centrifuged again at 3400 g for 10 minutes at 4°C in aliquots of approximately 30 ml and the combined pellets resuspended in 20 ml ice cold 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> 10% glycerol solution.
5. Following incubation on ice for 25 minutes 200 µl aliquots of the cells were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen* and stored at -80°C.

*liquid nitrogen can be substituted with dry ice + 100% EtOH bath, or omitted entirely for slightly less competent cells
