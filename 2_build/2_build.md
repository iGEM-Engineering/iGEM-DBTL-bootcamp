# Build Module

**The Build Module is currently under development.**

## Overview
In this module you will be preparing all the basic parts and the plasmid backbone with drop-out from your iGEM distribution. 
These DNA components are described in the [Introduction](/0_intro/0_intro.md) and further detail in the [Design Module](/1_design/1_design.md), so please read and understand those sections before starting the Build Module. 
This Build Module is a hands-on lab component of the DBTL Bootcamp. 

You will use those basic parts from the iGEM Distribution Kit in a typical Golden Gate Assembly (GGA) to create a series transcription units in a backbone. 
The GGA ligation will be transformed and plated on appropriate LB agar plates with selective antibiotic. 
You will pick a few RFP negative colonies to grow overnight in LB broth with selection and then perform “miniprep” plasmid extractions. 
You will also create glycerol stocks from your overnight cultures for long term storage at -80°C
You will then screen and characterize your positive miniprep DNA. 

If you are unable to assemble your designed constructs, or have decided not to do the Build Module, you can skip this module. 
Instead, you can transform a selection of Interlab devices directly from the distribution kit, and use those in the Test Module. 
No assembly required!

As with all experimental procedures, preparation is of key importance. 
This module will cover basic experimental techniques that are important in your team's activities for the iGEM competition. 
Everything you learn here is applicable irrespective of whether your team is developing tools for use with plants, mammalian cells, yeast or bacteria.

### What you will need to know before you start
- **IMPORTANT:** 
Before you start any work in the lab, make sure you have completed ALL of your institution's safety requirements.
- Core concepts introduced in the [Introduction](/0_intro/0_intro.md) and [Design Module](/1_design/1_design.md).
- Basic laboratory techniques and familiarity with all the equipment that will be used in the workflow/protocols below.
- Keeping a good lab notebook! Make sure to follow best practices and any guidelines from your lab group, but here are some general tips.

### Inputs
- Either your _in silico_ assembled constructs from completing the Design Module, OR a selection of three constructs from the Validation files.
    - If you want to skip the assembly portion entirely, you can there should be multiple already-built plasmids within the distribution kit that you can simply recover and be used for transformation of your competent cells transform into your competent cells, if you would rather not conduct any GGA reactions.


## Workflow Overview
The following is a 5-day plan for the Build Module, that will take you from transforming parts from the iGEM Distribution Kit, to assembling your constructs, and finally preparing glycerol stocks for future use. Depending on your level of expereience and/or available time, you may be able to combine the Day 3 work (transform assembly reaction) with Day 2, to shorten this workflow to 4 days.

This plan does not include time for the following:
- preparing & testing competent cells
- sequence confirmation of parts/constructs

<hr />


- **Day 1**
    - Transform plasmids from Distribution Kit
- **Day 2**
    - Make glycerol stocks
    - Make minipreps
        - Quantify plasmids
    - Setup assembly reaction
- **Day 3**
    - Transform assembly reaction
- **Day 4**
    - Screen colonies and select GFP-positive colonies
- **Day 5**
    - Make glycerol stocks
    - Miniprep plasmids
    - Confirm plasmid sequences


NOTE:  all parts from the distribution kit MUST first be transformed into competent cells.  Once these cells are growing, you can make glycerol stocks and miniprep the plasmids from overnight cultures.  These miniprepped plasmids are what you will use for GGA reactions.  DO NOT try to use DNA from the distribution kit in a GGA reaction.



## Protocols

[Redo intro]

There are two general types of competent _E. coli_ cells: chemically competent and electrocompetent. 
Electrocompetent cells require an electroporator which you may not have access to in your lab. 
So for this bootcamp, we will cover making and using chemically competent cells, since you only need a heated water bath or heat block to transform the plasmids into your cells. 

For chemically competent cells, you can either purchase these cells from a vendor or make them in the lab.
Vendors will often sell a range of competent cells for different purposes and transformation efficiencies. 
These commercial competent cells are validated so it can make troubleshooting easier, but they are an added expense. If you are unable to purchase competent cells, we have provided a protocol below so you can make your own cells and test their efficiency.
