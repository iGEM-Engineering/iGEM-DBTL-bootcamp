# Preparing Glycerol Stocks

## Overview
The protocol below is adapted from Addgene's [Creating Bacterial Glycerol Stocks for Long-term Storage of Plasmids](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/create-glycerol-stock/)

Glycerol stocks can be used to store plasmids for longer periods of time. A glycerol stock can last for many years when stored at -80°C.

## Materials needed
### Equipment
- Pipette (500 µl)

### Consumables
- 2 mL screw top tube or cryovial
- Pipette tips
- 50% glycerol
  - This can be made by diluting 100% glycerol in sterile water
- Overnight bacterial culture

## Protocol
1. After you have bacterial growth, add 500 μL of the overnight culture to 500 μL of 50% glycerol in a 2 mL screw top tube or cryovial and gently mix.
2. Freeze the glycerol stock tube at -80°C. The stock is now stable for years, as long as it is kept at -80°C. Subsequent freeze and thaw cycles reduce shelf life.


## Recovery
1. To recover bacteria from your glycerol stock, open the tube and use a sterile loop, toothpick or pipette tip to scrape some of the frozen bacteria off of the top. Streak on an agar plate with appropriate antibiotics.
    - **IMPORTANT: Do not let the glycerol stock unthaw! Keeping it frozen will improve its shelf-life**
2. Grow agar plate overnight at 37°C (or another appropriate temperature) and pick single colonies for further use.


## Tips and Tricks
- Write name, date, and content on the screw top tube or cryovial before adding any content. This will make it a lot easier to work with.
- Write name, date, and content on both the side and top of the tube if possible.
- It is adviced to prepare the glycerol stock at the same time plasmid miniprep-ing is performed.
