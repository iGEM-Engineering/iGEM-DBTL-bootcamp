# Glycerol Stock Preparation

## Overview
Glycerol stocks are used to freeze a sample of your _E. coli_ cells that have been transformed with your plasmid of interest. 

For the DBTL Bootcamp, you will make glycerol stocks for all the parts and plasmids you will use to assemble your constructs, and then once again for your completely assembled constructs.

This allows you to save a sample in the -80°C and then later revive the cells by growing them up on agar plates to get fresh colonies whenever you need to get more plasmid DNA out of the cells or when you will test your constructs.

In order to make this frozen sample of cells, you will need to add a cryoprotectant to your sample of cells to be frozen. We are using 80% glycerol. The standard amount to add of this cryoprotectant is one-fourth the volume of your cell culture. This gives a final concentration of 16% glycerol. 

## Materials needed
### Equipment
- Lab marker / Sharpie
- Micropipettors and tips for the following volumes: 
    - 1000 µL
- Vortex

### Consumables
- Cryovials (1 per culture)
- 80% glycerol, sterilized (cryoprotectant) 


## Protocol
1. Label all cryovials on the lid and side. Each tube should have:
    - The unque identifier of the part in plasmid: Ex. J23101 in pSB1C5SA
    - The antibiotic resistance of the plasmid (CmR or KanR)
    - The _E. coli_ strain
    - Your initials and the date.
2. Add 250µL of sterile 80% glycerol to each empty cryovial.
    - Pull the 80% glycerol into the pipette tip very slowly and let excess liquid drip off the outside of the tip before you remove it from the glycerol bottle. 
        > **Note:** Glycerol is extremely viscous. Use the 1000 µL pipettor; these tips have a larger aperture and make it easier to pipette the liquid. If available, you can microwave your 80% glycerol for 5-10 seconds to make the liquid easier to pipet 
    

3. Take your overnight liquid culture that you wish to create glycerol stock from. Carefully vortex the sample for a few seconds until it appears to be homogenous. 
4. Add 1000 µL of each culture to the appropriately labeled cryovial using a 1000 µL pipettor.
5. Vortex each cryovial at high speed for a few seconds to be sure that these solutions are uniformly mixed. 
6. Place the tubes in the -80°C freezer.
