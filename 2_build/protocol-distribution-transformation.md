# Distribution Kit Transformations

## Overview
To use the DNA in the Distribution Kit, we recommend the protocol below.

_Note:_ There is an estimated 1-2 ng of DNA in each well. When following this protocol, assume that you are transforming with 100-200 pg/µL. This is also why it is important to [test the efficiency](./protocol-competent-cell-efficiency.md) of your competent cells.

The protocol below is adapted from iGEM's [Distribution Handbook](https://technology.igem.org/distribution/handbook) and [Transformation Protocol](https://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Transformation)

## Materials needed
### Equipment
- Lab marker / Sharpie
- Container for ice
- 42°C Water bath (or heating block set to the same temperature)
- 37°C Incubators (oven and shaker)
- Sterile glass beads or sterile cell spreader
- Micropipettors and tips for the following volumes: 
    - 1 µL
    - 100 µL
    - 950 µL

### Consumables
- Distribution Kit plates
- Sterile deionized water
- 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
- Ice
- Competent cell aliquot(s)
- SOC media (warmed to room temperature)
- Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic

## Protocol
1. **Prepare the Distribution Kit Plate:** 
With a pipette tip, punch a hole through the foil cover into the corresponding well of the part that you want. 
Make sure you have properly oriented the plate. 
Do not remove the foil cover, as it could lead to cross contamination between the wells and loss of other plasmids.

2. **Resuspend the dried down plasmid DNA:** 
Pipette 10 µL of sterile distilled water into the well. 
Pipette up and down a few times and let sit for 5 minutes to make sure the dried DNA is fully resuspended. 
The resuspension will be red to orange in color, as the dried DNA has cresol red dye. 
    - Note: We recommend that you do not use TE to resuspend the dried DNA.

3. **Prepare tubes and ice bucket:** 
Label 1.5 ml tubes with part name or well location. 
Fill the lab ice bucket with ice, and pre-chill 1.5 ml tubes (one tube for each transformation) in a floating foam tube rack.

4. **Thaw competent cells on ice:** 
This may take 10-15 min for a 200 µl stock. Dispose of unused competent cells. 
Do not refreeze unused thawed cells, as it will drastically reduce transformation efficiency.

5. **Pipette 50 µl of competent cells into 1.5 ml tube:** 
50 µl in a 1.5 ml tube per transformation. 
Tubes should be labeled, pre-chilled, and in a floating tube rack for support. 
Keep all tubes on ice. 

6. **Pipette 1 µl of resuspended DNA into 1.5 ml tube:** 
Pipette from well into appropriately labeled tube. 
Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice.

7. **Close 1.5 ml tubes, incubate on ice for 30 min:** 
Tubes may be gently agitated/flicked to mix solution, but return to ice immediately.

8. **Heat shock tubes at 42°C for 45 sec:** 
1.5 ml tubes should be in a floating foam tube rack. 
Place the floating rack in a water bath set to 42°C to ensure the bottoms of the tubes are submerged.

9. **Incubate on ice for 5 min:** 
Return transformation tubes to the ice bucket and let them recover for 5 minutes.

10. **Pipette 950 µl SOC media to each transformation:** 
SOC should be warmed to room temperature before use. Check for contamination.

11. **Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour, shaking at 200-300 rpm**

12. **Pipette 100 µL of each transformation onto LB agar plate with the appropriate antibiotic:** 
Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. 
This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.

13. **Plate the remaining culture:** 
Spin down cells at 6800g for 3 mins and discard 800µL of the supernatant. 
Resuspend the cells in the remaining 100µL, and pipette each transformation onto LB agar plate with the appropriate antibiotic. 
Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. 
This increases the chance of getting colonies from lower concentration DNA samples.

14. **Incubate transformations overnight (14-18 hr) at 37°C:** 
Incubate the plates upside down (agar side up). 
If incubated for too long, colonies may overgrow and the antibiotics may start to break down; un-transformed cells will begin to grow.

15. **Pick single colonies:** 
Pick single colonies from transformations to grow up cell cultures overnight. 
Grow a single colony in 3-5 mLs of LB media plus the appropriate antibiotic and grow for 16-18 hours at 37°C shaking at 200-300 rpm. 
Use the resulting culture to [miniprep the DNA](./tips-miniprep.md) and make your own [glycerol stock](./protocol-glycerol-stock.md).  
We recommend using the miniprepped DNA to run QC tests, such as restriction digests and sequencing.
