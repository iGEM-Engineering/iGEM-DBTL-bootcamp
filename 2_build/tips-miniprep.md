First culture your E. coli, containing the transformed parts plasmids, overnight in LB broth with the appropriate antibiotic. 
Typically we use 4mL culture media in 14 mL snap cap tubes (rather than screw cap tubes) for microbiological work to allow air infiltration for growth in a shaking incubator.

Do not grow more than 16 hours as this will reduce yields when extracting DNA. 
If you can’t extract the plasmids straight away, store your cultures at 4°C but for no more than 8 hrs. 

All plasmid extraction methods/kits use a three step procedure for creating the neutralized lysate that will be added to the silica containing spin column. 
Wear gloves and a lab coat as the lysis buffer and neutralization buffers have chemicals that you don’t want to get on your skin. 
Use the volumes recommended by the kit or protocol that you are using. 

## Resuspension
After spinning down 1.5 to 3 mL of culture and removing the supernatant (media) you resuspend the cells with the resuspension buffer (some kits call this P1) by pipetting up and down aggressively. 
- In this step you must ensure that you have no clumps before going to the next step otherwise you will lower your yields due to poor lysis. 
- You can safely freeze the resuspension at this point or go on to the next step.
 
## Lysis
The next step involves lysing the cells to liberate the cell contents including plasmid and genomic DNA. 
For this step you add the lysis buffer (P2 in some kits). 
- Ensure that the SDS in your lysis buffer has not precipitated due to cooler temperature. 
    - Always look at if for a white precipitate and, if observed, warm the buffer between 37°C and 50°C. 
- When adding lysis buffer, **do not pipette**, rather invert the tube 8 times to get good mixing. 
    - Vigorous mixing will cause fragmentation of the genomic DNA resulting in a contaminated plasmid. You don’t want that when doing GGA!
- Let the lysis happen over 2 to 5 minutes. You will see clearing of the solution indicating that lysis has happened.

## Neutralize
The final step is to neutralize the lysate by adding the neutralization buffer (N3). 
- As with the lysis step you do not want to pipette the solution as this will also degrade the genomic DNA. Mix by inversion as with the lysis step. Look at the solution. You will see protein precipitate out and entangle the genomic DNA. 
- Spin the tubes in a microcentrifuge at room temperature as per the protocol.
- Label the spin columns and then transfer the supernatant containing the plasmid DNA. Be careful that you do not disturb the pellet. 
- Discard the flow through in the receiving tube (but not the tube). The waste should be collected and discarded according to your institution's chemical waste guidelines.

## Wash
Follow your protocol on the two wash steps but make sure to remove all of the ethanol with a final spin. Transferring any ethanol from the wash step will inhibit the enzymes used for GGA. Elute your miniprep DNA in a clean 1.5mL tube. Some centrifuges have tight spacing on the tube holes in the rotor so it might be easier to cut the cap of the collection tube and then transfer the DNA to a new tube for storage.

To remove any last residual traces of ethanol, the spin column in the clean 1.5 mL tube can be be heated to 70°C for a few minutes with the lid open.

## Elution
To increase the amount of DNA eluted, the elution buffer can be heated to 50 or 70°C before being applied on the column. If this is done, do take care that the lid is closed as to not let the warm buffer evaporate
