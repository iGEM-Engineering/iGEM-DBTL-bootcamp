# Lab Notebook Tips
In the 21st century, many people use electronic notebooks, that’s great!
Other people use paper notebooks, that’s also great! 
Regardless, make sure you are following best practices. 
You can talk to your mentors about what they prefer, but here are some key things to include/remember.

For electronic notebooks, if you use something like Benchling, make sure you are using hyperlinks to easily link your designed sequences (including part plasmids and final plasmids) to your entry. 
You can also hyperlink past entries to your current one, if you make separate entries. 
Make sure you attach or link all procedures to your entry.  

For all notebooks, make sure you include the following sections when conducting experiments. 
Your future self will thank you!

## Title/introduction
What is your current project or experiment? 

What are you trying to accomplish, why, and how does it continue for a previous experiment (if applicable)?

## Procedure/reagent checklist
Make sure the procedure is attached, referenced, or written out. 

Make sure you fully write out your reagents, and a checklist is IDEAL to make sure you have not forgotten to add something.

## Data/results

Make sure you include something related to data. 
Images and numbers are great, but data files are often more important given the need to present things digitally or to do analysis using an app or software

## Analysis/conclusion/next steps 
Make sure that you analyze and explain your data within the entry. 
You won’t remember what was in “lane 4” of your agarose gel or what some short hand notation from 2 months ago means in the future. 

Analysis should include why you think your experiment did or did not work (what did the data suggest and why?). 
And make sure you finish with some sort of conclusion and/or next steps.

**What comes next and why?**

This could include repeating a failed reaction and what you want to change. 

Or, what the next experimental step is. 
You never know when you will have a long weekend, come down sick, or even have to pass an experiment onto a teammate. 
As such, being very clear in your next steps and conclusions is REALLY important!
