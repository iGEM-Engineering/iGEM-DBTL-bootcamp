#### [The Sixth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study - How, what, when](https://video.igem.org/w/hAv6Etv1iGU16zqBjhAfMJ)
Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component of all engineering disciplines. 
Through previous InterLab studies, the Engineering Committee – with the help of many iGEM teams – has developed a robust measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and for cell density measurements. 
This year, we will extend our calibration from a one-color calibration (green) to multi-color calibrations (green-red-blue)!

In this webinar we will give an introduction into the purpose and outcomes of the Interlab study series as well as detailed instructions on how to participate and complete the 2022 Interlab study.

Join us in making synthetic biology measurements more reliable and interchangeable!
